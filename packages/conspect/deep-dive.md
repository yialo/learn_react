### [type] Fiber object

```js
// A Fiber is work on a Component that needs to be done or was done. There can
// be more than one per component.
export type Fiber = {|
  // These first fields are conceptually members of an Instance. This used to
  // be split into a separate type and intersected with the other Fiber fields,
  // but until Flow fixes its intersection bugs, we've merged them into a
  // single type.

  // An Instance is shared between all versions of a component. We can easily
  // break this out into a separate object to avoid copying so much to the
  // alternate versions of the tree. We put this on a single object for now to
  // minimize the number of objects created during the initial render.

  // Tag identifying the type of fiber.
  tag: WorkTag,

  // Unique identifier of this child.
  key: null | string,

  // The value of element.type which is used to preserve the identity during
  // reconciliation of this child.

  // The local state associated with this fiber.
  stateNode: any,

  // return fiber since we've merged the fiber and instance.

  // Remaining fields belong to Fiber

  // The Fiber to return to after finishing processing this one.
  // This is effectively the parent, but there can be multiple parents (two)
  // so this is only the parent of the thing we're currently processing.
